# DevOps Assessment Scenario: Designing a Microservices Deployment on EKS with GitOps and Terraform

## Background

You are tasked with designing the deployment and management infrastructure for a microservices-based application. The target environment is AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and the deployment should be managed using GitOps principles and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. Additionally, the setup needs to integrate a CI/CD pipeline.

## Objectives

### 1. EKS Cluster Design

- Describe how you would design an EKS cluster for this purpose.
- Discuss the considerations for worker node configurations and network settings.
- Outline your approach to monitoring and logging within the cluster.

### 2. Application Deployment Strategy

- Present a high-level design for deploying a multi-tier application (front-end, back-end, database) on Kubernetes.
- Explain how you would manage service discovery and load balancing.
- Discuss your strategy for handling secrets within the Kubernetes environment.

### 3. GitOps Implementation Plan

- Describe how you would set up a Git repository to manage Kubernetes manifests.
- Detail your choice of GitOps tool (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) and how it will synchronize the cluster state with the repository.
- Explain the process for automatic updates in the cluster upon changes in the repository.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Design

- Outline a CI/CD pipeline for this application, specifying your choice of tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
- Describe how the pipeline would handle code commits, builds, tests, and deployments.
- Discuss strategies for rollbacks, zero-downtime deployments, and testing stages.

### 5. Security and Compliance Approach

- Explain how you would secure the Kubernetes cluster and the application.
- Discuss Kubernetes best practices for security you would follow.
- Describe your approach for compliance and security audits.

### 6. Scalability and High Availability Planning

- Detail how you would ensure scalability based on varying loads.
- Describe the high availability strategies you would implement for both the EKS cluster and the application.

### 7. Documentation and Reporting

- Discuss how you would document this setup.
- Explain your approach to reporting and how you would communicate the architecture and processes to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
